<h1>DeepMarket Project</h1>

In the summer of 2018, I worked at an internship at Portland State University. I worked in a team headed by <a href = "http://web.cecs.pdx.edu/~aryafare/">Professor Ehsan Aryafar</a> and helped his team develop a product to cheaply allow users to access computing resources. 

In the intership, I worked on two significant projects. The first was creating the website for the team's product. The code of the website is hosted on <a href = "https://github.com/shared-systems/website">Github</a>.  Below is an old image of the homepage. You can find the current website <a href = "https://deepmarket.cs.pdx.edu/">here</a>.

The second project I worked on was learning how to work with Nodejs and express. Node is a runtime environment that allows developers to use Javascript to create servers. Express is a framework that simplifies the creation of web applications in node. 

I created a simple application that would mimic the functionalities of a library website. A user could "checkout" and "return" virtual books, as well as see the available books and the books in their own account. The javascript files can be found <a href ="https://github.com/patrickhuang112/library_app">here</a>.
