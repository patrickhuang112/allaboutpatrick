I once took an online class called Web Design 1 from CTY. Â The final project of this class was creating a website that highlighted a specific interest of mine. I created my website about one of my favorite games at the time, Battlefield Bad Company 2.

The next year I took another CTY class, this time on javascript programming. The final project for this class was also a website. This website replicated an animal care shop's website with basic functionalities such as forms, buttons and other javascript abilities.

Here's a link to download the pages and code for my second coding project, the Doggy Day Care website.
