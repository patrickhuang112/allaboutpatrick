One of my favorite things to do is to short clip edit. Short clip editing is bascially syncing music to video game clips and adding effects to create an artistic piece. I have a whole <a href = "https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC0vGApkXxaLQNQzw0ZC1SyQ">YouTube channel</a> with my edits. On this website, I hope to showcase the work I have created and provide tips to help prospective editors join the community.
