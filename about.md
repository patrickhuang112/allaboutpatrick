My name is Patrick Huang and I am currently a senior at Southridge High School in Beaverton, Oregon. I am very passionate about coding and also really love video editing. I have a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/user/xtradv112">YouTube channel</a> where I upload all my past and current editing projects. Link down below
