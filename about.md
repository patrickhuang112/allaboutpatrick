My name is Patrick Huang and I am Freshman at Carnegie Mellon University in Pittsburgh, Pennslyvania. I am very passionate about coding and also really love video editing. I have a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/user/xtradv112">YouTube channel</a> where I upload all my past and current editing projects. 

If you like to contact me, please reach out to my email at <u>pat.b.huang@gmail.com</u>You can also view my linkedin page <a href = "https://www.linkedin.com/in/patrick-huang-b6a971191/">here</a>

Finally, if you would like to view some of my projects, I backup all of my code (including this website's!) on GitHub. You can find all my repositories <a href="https://github.com/patrickhuang112">here</a>
