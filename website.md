title: Creating this website
---

This page will detail the steps I did to create this website. Using my steps as a template, you can create your very own website today!

<b>Step 1</b>: What I first did was visit the jekyll website and go to this page about jekyll on windows 10.

<a href = "https://jekyllrb.com/docs/windows/">Jekyll on windows</a> 

I followed the instructions on the website and eventually had everything ready for website creation

<b>Step 2</b>: I searched online for jekyll themes. The theme I settled on was called lanyon, a very simplistic theme that would allow me to quickly launch my website. 

<a href = "http://lanyon.getpoole.com/">Website showcasing the lanyon theme</a>

I then headed over to their github repository and forked their code to my account. After forking, I cloned the files to my local computer, to a folder called "allaboutpatrick".
"git clone 'link from github' "

<b>Step 3</b>: Editing pages and content was quite easily. Each content file was in markdown so modifying content was very simple. Once I had finished modifying my content, I uploaded my changes to my own repository on GitHub to keep an online revision control.

<br />

<pre>git status </pre> I used this command to view what content was to be pushed online.

<pre>git add "file name" </pre> I used this command to add revised local files to be pushed online.

<pre>git commit -am "comment" </pre> I used this command to add a comment detailing what was changed in the local file.

<pre>git push</pre>I used this command to push comments and local files online.

<b>Step 4</b>: Setting up Amazon Web services. My father and I worked to buy a domain and to set up the address for the website. Below is a screenshot of the settings of the bucket that the files are located.

<img src= "https://allaboutpatrick.files.wordpress.com/2018/09/ss5.png?ssl=1&w=1000" style = "margin: auto" />

<img src= "https://allaboutpatrick.files.wordpress.com/2018/09/ss4.png?ssl=1&w=1000" style = "margin: auto" />
<br />
<br />
After configuring your bucket settings, it is important to copy the link you see down below into your route 53.
<br />
<br />
<img src="https://allaboutpatrick.files.wordpress.com/2018/09/imp1.png?ssl=1&w=1000" style = "margin: auto" />
<br />
<br />
Delete your domain name from the beginning of the link (patrickhuang.me for me) and copy the link to your page in Route 53 down below
<br />

<b>Step 5</b>: The contents of my website were stored in the Amazon S3 bucket. To push local changes to the actual website on the world wide web, a series of commands were executed.

First, I navigated to my "_site" folder locally. From there, I ran bash and ran this command.

<pre>aws s3 sync . s3://patrickhuang.me</pre>

This command essentially synchronizes the local files with the files in the S3 bucket, essentially updating the public website.
