Technique #2: Pan Crop

Anybody who has worked with image retouching software should know what pan crop is. Pan crop is essentially the technique of resizing and reshaping the video clip. This technique is often very important as it really helps highlight different areas of the screen and gives movement to an otherwise static clip. There are whole edits that are very focused on heavy intense pan cropping.

In Sony Vegas, the basic usage of Pan Cropping is by moving the little icons in or out. Contrary to intuition, moving the little screen in will make the image bigger and moving it out will make it smaller. In this screenshot, you can see the little rectangle and moving it in and out will change the size on the screen

There is also another alternative to pan crop that many editors use. This is called shake and there are many plugins that replicate this effect but the most popular by far is s_shake (part of the sapphire plugins). This plugin replicates an artificial shaking effect on the video. This is often much easier and can look a lot less fake for the purpose of some clip movement.
