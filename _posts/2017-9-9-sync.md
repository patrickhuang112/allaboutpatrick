Technique #3: Sync

This is by far the most basic and easy to understand technique. Really, you shouldn't even need a tutorial on this. In the most basic definition, sync is the listening to the song that you are editing to and making sure that the video clips that you are editing to fit to certain times and part of the music. This way, when you play the edit, the whole edit flows to the feeling, idea, and vibe of the song that you are editing to.

Speaking in more advanced terms, sync is used to describe where you decide to cut in your edit. Really good sync entails the editor listening closely to the song and realizing where the big beats, the drops, the impact places are and appropriately cutting and editing the clips to fit that. Basic sync is very easy to teach; you essentially look at the waveform composition of your music and just see where the beats are. However, really good sync is also a learned technique and req<span style="font-size:16px;">uires practice and lots of trial and</span><span style="font-size:16px;"> error</span><span style="font-size:16px;"> to understand how to properly to sync to the song.</span>

(As you can see, basic sync is essentially just looking at your song and seeing where the beats are)
