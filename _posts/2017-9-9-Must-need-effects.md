Some Effects all editors need in every single edit. Heres some of the most important ones
<ol>
	<li>RSMB (ReelSmartMotionBlur): This is really what makes edits look good. RSMB applies blur to whenever there is motion in the video (degree is based on degree of motion). It applies it in such a way that watching edits without RSMB is very apparent as you can clearly see the snappiness and less fluid and aesthetic nature of the edit. Trust me, RSMB is a must do for EVERY SINGLE edit that you make.</li>

 <li>MBL (Magic Bullet Looks): The easiest to use and most useful color correction tool. It basically provides every single possible tool you could want to color correct and essentially make your edit look better. It has options for every single type of color correction and is absolutely essential for post production of any single edit.</li>

<li>Curves/Levels: These two effects should come standard in nearly all basic editing software. These essentially help control the levels and amounts of whites/blacks/ each color in your edit. These are very simple tools but used correctly, they can have very dramatic effects on the look of your edit.</li>

<li>Sapphire plugin pack: A very impactful with lots of important effects that will really help customize your edit. While it is not essential, these effects are quite helpful in making your edit more aesthetic</li>

<li>5. BCC plugins: Same with Sapphires.</li>
</ol>
To sum up, basically #1, #2, and #3 are the most important plugins that you literally should be using in every single you ever make

Good day
