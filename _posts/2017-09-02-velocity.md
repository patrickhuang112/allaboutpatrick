## Short Clip Editing Technique 1: Velocity

Velocity is the basis for all editing. Velocity is the technique of adjusting the speed and playback rate of each clip that you use in your short clip edit. Most people who try and teach editing will state that learning velocity is the most key and most important technique of editing that any new editor should learn.

The basics of velocity is this. Each point has a numerical value from -100 to 300 (for Sony Vegas 13). Adjusting the height of the points in the track will adjust the speed of the video at that particular point in time. For example, if you have a point that is 50 and then another point 1s later that is 100, the video clip will start at 50% speed and eventually get to 100% speed based on what kind of transition you have.

Really besides explaining the basics of velocity, it is kinda difficult to really teach velocity. Velocity and another "technique" called flow are really experienced based techniques. They require practice and watching a lot of other edits to really understand how to do properly. However, there are a few good tutorials on YouTube that at least try to explain the concepts in an easier to understand manner.

One extra note, if you mainly edit in After Effects, the velocity equivalent in that editing program is called Time Remapping. The difference between this and velocity is that time Remapping is essentially picking points where you want the video to be and then just internally adjusting the speed of how the video transitions between the two videos. I personally never time remap so to understand more, watch another tutorial by ReeDy :D
